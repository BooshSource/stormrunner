It's been a long while since I first had a go at decompiling this game (two years... Really? Really that long ago?). I might try to properly fix it at some point. A combination of Java decompiling being inherently unreliable and the code being written for an ancient java compiler kind of conspired against me.

A little background for the game:

This game was released in (*consults google*) the year 2000. At the time, it was the largest Java game ever written. If you can get it to work, it's poor by the standards of the games of today, but at the time, it was revolutionary.

I do have the binaries. They work. If anyone wants them, please ask, and I'll be happy to provide them.
